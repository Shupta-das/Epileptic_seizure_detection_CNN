# Seizure Detection from Decomposed EEG Signal through 1D and 2D Feature Representation and Convolutional Neural Network
## Overview
This study investigates the well-performed EEG-based ES detection method by decomposing EEG signals.
## Prerequisites
The Python programming language is used to conduct the experiments. Decomposition and feature extraction, with model training, are powered by a P100 GPU of Kaggle's platform. 5-fold cross-validation (CV) is used to split training and test sets.
